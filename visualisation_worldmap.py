#%% Create binary graph

# create list of unique combinations
# every unique combination of [soure airport id - destination airport id]
# loading these data into nx
# output: huge ass big crazy graph 


#%% (create weighted)

# create list of unique combinations
# every unique combination of [soure airport id - destination airport id]. But then correct for A to B == B to A

# this is in matlab: [outputname, IA, IC] = unique(var)
# probably .unique also holds something like this in python


#%% Visualisation on a word map (use binary!)

# take coordinates as location for the hubs of the binary graph
