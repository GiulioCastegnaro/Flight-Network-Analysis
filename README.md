# Flight-Network-Analysis
JAAP VAN DER AAR | KIRSTEN BULSINK | GIULIO CASTEGNARO 

This is a project in which the airlines and airports all over the world are analyzed in Python using graph theory
The project is part of the course Computational Thinking at Universiteit Utrecht. The students have dealt with Python code and data about more than 60.000 flights from (and to) every part of the World.

There are several packages that we decided to implement in the program for various purposes. 
They are: 
matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/) for plots and displaying data and statistics. 
pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/) for organizing and better handling the dataframe 
numpy (https://www.numpy.org/)
networkx (https://networkx.github.io/) for the creation and manipulations of graphs and networks starting from flights data
basemap (https://matplotlib.org/basemap/users/installing.html) for visualization purposes 
operator (https://docs.python.org/3.0/library/operator.html) for ......?

GITHUB LINK 
Since this was a group project, we thought it would have been a good idea to implement the use of a version control like GitHub. With this easy tool we managed to mantain the code updated and available everywhere for everyone. 

THE DATASETS 
The datasets have been downloaded from kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/open-flights/flight-route-database) and have been then merged together in our code. Furthermore we decided to implement a dataframe containing airlines information (https://www.kaggle.com/open-flights/airline-database), like their complete names, for better users' comprehension.
