#%% Find biggests hubs
# use .degree (in or out) - undirected to find top (10) (might be done with 1:11 sorted?)
# make it weighted or not

#%% visualisation

# make bar graph with degrees of the top hubs

# options:
# ten biggest hubs as 'weighted' hubs on the world hubs

# compare complete network with network of the top 10 hubs, so problably these ten will 
# already cover almost the whole world. 

#%% optional: What is the most important airport per airline e.g. is 
# Charles de Gaulle or Schiphol Airport the most connected hub of Air-France-KLM?


#%% Compare two/three/more biggest airlines:

# so count the number of 'airline' in routes file. But then correct for A to B == B to A
# this is the number of edges in the network of the airline
# So visualize top ... with bar graph/circle or whatever
# optional: visualize top ... in world map 

# Compare using all the graph theory measures such as nodes/degree/edges whatever ...
# efficiency!!!! (average shortest path length function - inverse is measure of global efficiency)
