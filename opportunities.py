#%% Opportunities, goal: find new possible connections/flight

# use the script of comparison.py to find the top ... hubs (based on .sorted)

# visualize the top ... hubs connections
# find out which package to use for adjecency/connectivity matrix
# or just code ourselves

# first try binary: 
# are there any connections their. find(0)

# otherwise, do it weighted and see which is used least

 


# ideas for extra time:
# divide connections, make different colors. local to local, big hub to big hub
# don't do top ..., but loop through to find the first not existing connectivity of the biggest hubs
